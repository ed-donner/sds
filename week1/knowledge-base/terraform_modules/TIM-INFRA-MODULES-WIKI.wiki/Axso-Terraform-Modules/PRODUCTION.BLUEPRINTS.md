# Blueprints

COMING SOON...

The below list of blueprints are **collections** of **Services** available for use by any Axso employee to build infrastructure architectures in Azure that can be deployed as a single package.  

**Blueprints** are comprised of multiple **Services** combined together to form a **Reference Architecture**. For example a **Blueprint** may be comprised of a **Resource Group**, **Subnets**, **Storage Accounts**, **Key Vaults**, **Virtual Machines**, **SQL Servers** etc. to form a fully built out reference architecture.
