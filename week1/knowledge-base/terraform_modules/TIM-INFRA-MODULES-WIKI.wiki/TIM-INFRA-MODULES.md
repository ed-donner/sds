# Welcome to the Axso Terraform Self Service Wiki (DYOS - Do Your Own System)

Welcome to the Axso self service Terraform modules.  
The modules are designed to be used in a self service manner, with the ability to be used in a CI/CD pipeline.  
You will find lots of valuable information in this wiki with regards to process, procedures, ways of working and technical details.  

Please note that the **Cloud Infrastructure Team** work very closely with **Axpo Security** to build and develop modules within the acceptable use guard rails set out by the security team, **Azure Policies** are applied to subscriptions by the **Security Team** to ensure that only approved services and configurations can be deployed.  

The **Cloud Infrastructure Team** will rigorously test all modules, including against an **Azure Policy** applied subscription, before they are made available for use in the **Axso Terraform Self Service** repository, based on the **Azure Policies** set out by the **Security Team**. Please note that any ad-hoc changes to the **Azure Policies** will not be reflected in modules straight away, and may require a review of the modules affected to ensure that they are still compliant before a new version updated is released.
